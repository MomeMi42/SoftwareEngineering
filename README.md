Currently, the project isn't hosted on anything. So you can use [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) to serve the html files in the root of the project.

Right click on any of `.html` file, select `Open with Live Server`, you should see the website opens at `http://localhost:5500` (or other port).
